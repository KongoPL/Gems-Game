## What I learned?

## What took me most time?

* Correctly working logic of game board

## Game rules
* Swap gems by using your mouse.
* You can't swap gems that won't make long enough chain.
* Stack 4 or more same gems in one line to destroy them.
* After destroying gems, new gems are spawned.
* If there is no possibility to make successfull swap, board is refilled with new gems.
